# Starting
I decided to use Adobe Illustrator for this assignment because the program has been a tool that I have wanted to learn for a while. It is a more powerful tool than Figma but that meant that there was a steeper learning curve to be able to create a logo that I was proud of.

The inspiration in the colours used and some of the theming to the logo was from the Calgary Wranglers logo.

# Issues
My main issue in the assignment was learning how to align items in Illustrator. For the flames at the bottom of the wings, I wanted to spread them out evenly so I was able to achieve that after taking each flame and using a distribution align to align them evenly around the space that I gave the flames. 

My other issue in the project was that I was not sure how to colour the triangle in CSS since I gave it a colour gradient. The problem was caused by the linear gradient that was given a separate link in the svg code and the fill was linked to the gradient. Because of this, it was the one path that I wasn't able to colour with css.
