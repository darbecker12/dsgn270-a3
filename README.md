# SVG Logo Design
## Darryl Becker

The logo design is my take on a different Calgary Wranglers logo influenced by my passing for aviation.
I have named it the Flying Wranglers because of the wings on either side. The stars on each wing was created by a boolean exclude and the W in the triangle part is the W for the Wranglers. Since the Calgary Wranglers are the farm team for the Calgary Flames, I included some flames on the bottom of the wings.
